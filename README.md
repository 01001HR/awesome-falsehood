# Awesome Falsehood [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated list of awesome falsehoods programmers believe in.


## Foreword

*Falsehood* articles are a form of commentary on a particular subject, and are
appreciated by the developper community at large for their effectiveness and
density. They're a convenient written form to approach an unfamiliar domain by
dispelling myths, point out common pitfalls, show inconsistencies and
subtilities.

They might looks like to some as a suite of wordy unit-tests covering extensive
edge-cases provided by real-world usage.


## What's a good candidate for this awesome list?

### *Falsehood*-like articles

Articles following the *falsehood* scheme are prime candidates for inclusion in
this awesome list.

These articles starts with the hypothesis that developers have a naive, simple
view of the subject at hand. Then procceed to list a set of candid assumptions
that might be held by such programmers. Each one is intentionnaly false, and
sometimes illustrated by a counter-example.

A list of falsehood is crafted as a progression that is designed to refine
concepts. Having read the whole list of falsehood, the reader should pocssess a
global, if not complete, overview of the domain being targetted by the article,
including most, if not all, its pitfalls, edges-cases and inconsistencies.

### Library

When possible, we provide a list of programming libraries or modules that may
solve, or try to, the complexities and idiosyncracies pointed by the
*falsehood* articles above.

### Data structures

Data models and structures generic enough to cover and addresses most of the
falsehoods are also welcome in this page.
