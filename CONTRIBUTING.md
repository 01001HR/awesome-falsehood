## Guidelines

- Only one list item per commit.

- Only one commit per pull-request. Always squash commits after applying
changes.

- List item requirements:

  - Check the new item you want to add to the list is a [good
  candidate](README.md#good-candidates).
  - Must follow this template:
  `- [Link Title](https://example.com) - A short description.`.
  - Link title must be [title-cased](http://titlecapitalization.com), AP style.
  - Link title must be stripped out of the "*programmers believe*" part to keep
  it compact.
  - URL must use HTTPs protocol if available.
  - Keep descriptions concise, maximum number of characters is 350.
  - Description must ends with a period.

- Add a section if needed.

  - Eventually add a description to the section.
  - Section title must be linked to from the [table of
  contents](README.md#contents).
  - Sections must be alphabetically sorted.

- Search past and current issues and pull-requests for previous suggestions
before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate or a work in progress.

- Check your spelling and grammar.

- Remove any trailing whitespaces.

- Use spaces, no tabs, for indention.

- Cut long lines of text after 80 characters. Only exception is to let Markdown
content be properly rendered.

- Send a pull-request with the reason why the linked resource is awesome.
